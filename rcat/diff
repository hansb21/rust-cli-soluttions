1 The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
1 Don't worry, spiders,
2 I keep house
3 casually.
1 The bustle in a house
2 The morning after death
3 Is solemnest of industries
4 Enacted upon earth,—
5 
6 The sweeping up the heart,
7 And putting love away
8 We shall not want to use again
9 Until eternity.
